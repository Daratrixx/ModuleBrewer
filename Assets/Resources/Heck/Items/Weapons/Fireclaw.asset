  itemDescription: "Blade shaped like a claw and imbued with fire, used by the first
    born of Shade. Those weapons symbolise the bound between goddess and her first
    born.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it was made from some sort of ivory or bone, but it
    was obviously smitten and not sculpted. Yet, nobody could reproduce such a craft
    nowadays."
