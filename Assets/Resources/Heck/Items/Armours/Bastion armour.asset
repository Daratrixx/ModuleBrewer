  itemDescription: "Gigantic iron armour used by the armies of Bastion. Encaged in
    heavy metal, the wearer is protected from most physical attacks. It's weight doesn't
    allow complex movements or spell casting.\r\n\r\nThe people of Bastion were always
    at war with the Choruds. They designed this armour specifically to protect from
    the beasts claws. The amount of iron required to craft such an armour explains
    why Bastion don't want to give up the eastern mines."
